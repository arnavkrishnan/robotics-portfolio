    <h2>About This Certification</h2>
    <p>
      Onshape is a cloud-based CAD (Computer-Aided Design) platform that enables collaborative 3D modeling and design. 
      The CAD Basics certification demonstrates proficiency in fundamental CAD concepts and skills essential for 
      engineering and robotics design work. I also completed the CAD for robotics training pathway. This taught me about how CAD is used in real-world engineering / robotics applications.
      However, I am unable to show the documents for that course at this time due to limitations regarding the display of .docx files on webpages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these 2 certifications (Basics and for Robotics), I was able to gain practice and learning in creating 3D models, assemblies, and technical drawings. 
      The coursework of both pathways covered key topics including sketching, part modeling, assembly constraints, and design documentation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      CAD for Robotics was additionally covering specialized topics such as manufacturing 
      considerations, custom component creation, design communication, collaboration workflows, and drivetrain assembly—all 
      essential skills for competitive robotics and real-world engineering applications.
