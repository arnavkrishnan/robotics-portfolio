    <h2>About This Certification</h2>
    <p>
      The OSHA 10-Hour General Industry course is a foundational course/ training program that teaches workers about common workplace hazards, and the OSHA standards. The certification is widely recognized, by a variety of industries and companies, and demonstrates a workers' committment to maintaining a safe working enviorment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I completed this course through 360training, an OSHA-authorized online training provider. The course covered a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) hazard communication, personal protective equipment (PPE), electrical safety, material handling, walking and working surfaces, and emergency action plans. The modules also included a variety of formats, from reading to interactive activities such as answering questions, matching terms and defitions, or filling in blanks.
    </p>
      Through this course, I have learned much about workplace hazards, and the neccesary safety measures, which is particularly valuable in robotics and engineering environments where dangers do exist, and safety is the priority.
